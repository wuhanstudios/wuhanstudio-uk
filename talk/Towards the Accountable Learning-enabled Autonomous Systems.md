Description:

Deep learning models have been deployed in various robotic systems, from environment perception to planning and navigation. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of deep neural networks is raising concerns in safety-critical systems. This project intends to unleash the power of deep learning on robotic systems, but in a safe, controllable, and interpretable way.
